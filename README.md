========

TA Buddy: Desktop application - absolutely portable **SCRIPT** - download and run. The only requirement is Java 7 or later. The supported operating systems are: Linux, Windows, MacOS.

Why is it script? Because you may alter everything that you want at runtime with Scala REPL.

[See TA Buddy: Desktop documentation](http://digimead.github.io/digi-TABuddy-desktop/).

Use [TA Buddy: Desktop Launcher](http://storage.googleapis.com/digimead/tabuddy-desktop/launcher/0.1/launcher.jar) to start the application. It is a helper that collects all required libraries, generates initial configuration files and keeps application up-to-date. It is compartible with Java 7 and later. You may start it with ```java -jar launcher.jar```. Add ```-help``` argument for launcher options. [More about launcher...](https://github.com/digimead/digi-TABuddy-launcher)

Note! Launcher is not required for application itself, so you may delete it after initial configuration will be prepared.
